# Lambdust

A modern, high-performance Scheme interpreter with gradual typing and algebraic effect systems, built in Rust with R7RS-large compliance and advanced programming language features.

## Features

### Core Language Features
- **R7RS-large Compliance**: Full implementation of R7RS-small with extensive R7RS-large library support
- **Gradual Typing System**: Four-level type system from dynamic to fully static typing
- **Algebraic Effect System**: Composable effects with handlers and monadic programming
- **Advanced Macro System**: Hygienic macros with full R7RS macro support
- **Metaprogramming**: Reflection, code generation, and program analysis capabilities

### Performance & Concurrency  
- **High Performance**: Optimized evaluation with SIMD operations and performance monitoring
- **Concurrent Evaluation**: Actor model with message passing and parallel computation
- **Advanced Data Structures**: High-performance containers with SRFI implementations
- **Memory Management**: Sophisticated garbage collection with pressure monitoring

### Developer Experience
- **Interactive REPL**: Advanced read-eval-print loop with debugging capabilities
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Profiling, benchmarking, and performance analysis
- **Foreign Function Interface**: Safe C interoperability with dynamic library loading
- **Extensive Documentation**: Complete API reference and developer guides

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/lambdust.git
cd lambdust
cargo build --release
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start interactive REPL
cargo run

# Run a Scheme file
cargo run -- examples/hello.scm

# Run with specific features
cargo run --features "simd,profiling" -- program.scm
```

### Simple Example

```scheme
;; Hello World with gradual typing
(define (greet name : String) : String
  (string-append "Hello, " name "!"))

;; Using effects for I/O
(define-effect-type Console
  (print : String -> Unit)
  (read-line : Unit -> String))

;; Effectful program
(define (interactive-greeting)
  (with-console-handler
    (do [name (read-line)]
        (print (greet name)))))
```

## Architecture Overview

Lambdust is built with a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns across multiple specialized systems:

### Core Systems
- **Evaluation Engine**: Monadic architecture with clean separation of concerns
- **Type System**: Gradual typing with inference and constraint solving  
- **Effect System**: Algebraic effects with handler-based composition
- **Runtime Coordination**: Advanced effect coordination and resource management

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **Parser & Lexer**: Robust parsing with error recovery and source mapping
- **Module System**: Dynamic module loading with dependency resolution
- **FFI System**: Safe foreign function calls with memory management
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe primitives with actor model support
