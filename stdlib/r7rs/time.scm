;; R7RS Standard Library - Time Module
;; Provides time-related procedures for (scheme time)

  (begin
    ;; Time procedures are implemented as Rust primitives that
    ;; interface with the system's high-resolution timer
    
    ;; These procedures should be available from the Rust stdlib:
    ;; - current-second: returns current time as seconds since epoch
    ;; - current-jiffy: returns current time in high-resolution "jiffies" 
    ;; - jiffies-per-second: returns the resolution of jiffies
    
    ;; The Rust implementation handles:
    ;; - High-precision timing using system timers
    ;; - Cross-platform timing interfaces
    ;; - Monotonic vs. wall-clock time considerations
    ;; - Overflow handling for long-running programs
    
    ;; Example implementations (these would be Rust primitives):
    
    ;; (define (current-second)
    ;;   "Returns the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch."
    ;;   ;; Rust implementation would use std::time::SystemTime::now()
    ;;   ;; and convert to seconds since UNIX_EPOCH
    ;;   (error "current-second not yet implemented"))
    
    ;; (define (current-jiffy)
    ;;   "Returns the current time in jiffies (high-resolution ticks)."
    ;;   ;; Rust implementation would use std::time::Instant::now()
    ;;   ;; or a high-resolution timer, converted to integer jiffies
    ;;   (error "current-jiffy not yet implemented"))
    
    ;; (define (jiffies-per-second)
    ;;   "Returns the number of jiffies per second."
    ;;   ;; This should return a constant representing the jiffy resolution
    ;;   ;; Common values: 1000000 (microseconds) or 1000000000 (nanoseconds)
    ;;   1000000) ;; Example: microsecond resolution
    
    ;; Usage examples:
    ;; - Measuring elapsed time: (- (current-jiffy) start-jiffy)
    ;; - Converting to seconds: (/ elapsed-jiffies (jiffies-per-second))
    ;; - Getting wall-clock time: (current-second)
    
    ;; The jiffy-based timing is preferred for performance measurement
    ;; as it provides higher resolution and is monotonic (doesn't go backwards
    ;; due to system clock adjustments).
