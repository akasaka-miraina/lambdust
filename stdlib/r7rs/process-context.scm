    ;; Most process context procedures are implemented as Rust primitives
    ;; that interface with the operating system
    
    ;; These procedures should be available from the Rust stdlib:
    ;; - command-line: returns command line arguments as a list of strings
    ;; - get-environment-variable: gets a single environment variable
    ;; - get-environment-variables: gets all environment variables as an alist
    ;; - exit: normal program termination with optional exit code
    ;; - emergency-exit: immediate program termination bypassing cleanup
    
    ;; The Rust implementation handles:
    ;; - Cross-platform command line access
    ;; - Unicode handling in environment variables and arguments  
    ;; - Proper exit code handling
    ;; - Signal handling for emergency exit
    ;; - Security considerations for environment access
    
    ;; Example implementations (these would be Rust primitives):
    
    ;; (define (command-line)
    ;;   "Returns the command line arguments as a list of strings."
    ;;   ;; Rust implementation would use std::env::args()
    ;;   (error "command-line not yet implemented"))
    
    ;; (define (get-environment-variable name)
    ;;   "Gets the value of environment variable name, or #f if not set."
    ;;   ;; Rust implementation would use std::env::var()
    ;;   (error "get-environment-variable not yet implemented"))
    
    ;; (define (get-environment-variables)
    ;;   "Returns all environment variables as an association list."
    ;;   ;; Rust implementation would use std::env::vars()
    ;;   (error "get-environment-variables not yet implemented"))
    
    ;; (define (exit . code)
    ;;   "Exits the program with optional exit code (default 0)."
    ;;   ;; Rust implementation would use std::process::exit()
    ;;   (let ((exit-code (if (null? code) 0 (car code))))
    ;;     (error "exit not yet implemented")))
    
    ;; (define (emergency-exit . code)
    ;;   "Immediately exits without cleanup, with optional exit code."
    ;;   ;; Rust implementation would use std::process::abort() or similar
    ;;   (let ((exit-code (if (null? code) 0 (car code))))
    ;;     (error "emergency-exit not yet implemented")))
