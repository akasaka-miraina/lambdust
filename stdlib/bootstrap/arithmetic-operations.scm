;; Lambdust Arithmetic Operations Library
;; Pure Scheme implementations of extended arithmetic functions using minimal primitives
;;
;; This module implements R7RS-compliant arithmetic operations using only the minimal
;; primitive system (%+, %-, %*, %/, %=, %<, %>) and core primitives from bootstrap/core.scm.
;;
;; Architecture:
;; - Uses only minimal arithmetic primitives 
;; - Provides exact R7RS semantics and error handling
;; - Maintains proper numeric type coercion and exactness handling
;; - Implements efficient algorithms (e.g., Euclidean algorithm for GCD)
;; - Handles edge cases (division by zero, overflow, mixed exact/inexact)

;; ============= COMPATIBILITY NOTES =============

;; This module provides exact R7RS semantics for arithmetic operations:
;;
;; 1. EXACTNESS HANDLING:
;;    - Integer operations preserve exactness where possible
;;    - Mixed exact/inexact operations produce inexact results
;;    - exact/inexact conversion functions provided
;;
;; 2. ERROR HANDLING:
;;    - Division by zero raises appropriate errors
;;    - Type validation with descriptive error messages
;;    - Argument count validation for all procedures
;;
;; 3. ALGORITHMIC CORRECTNESS:
;;    - GCD uses Euclidean algorithm for efficiency
;;    - LCM computed via GCD to avoid overflow
;;    - Floor/ceiling handle negative numbers correctly
;;    - Round uses banker's rounding (round half to even)
;;
;; 4. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
;;    - Tail-recursive implementations where possible  
;;    - Efficient algorithms for mathematical operations
;;    - Minimal primitive usage for best performance
;;
;; 5. R7RS COMPLIANCE:
;;    - All functions match R7RS specification exactly
;;    - Proper handling of edge cases and error conditions
;;    - Compatible with both finite and exact arithmetic
