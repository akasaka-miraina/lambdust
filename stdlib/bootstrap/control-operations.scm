;; Control Flow Operations
;; 
;; This library implements higher-level control abstractions in pure Scheme,
;; building from minimal primitives. These implementations focus on functions
;; that can be implemented without requiring macro system support.
;;
;; Design principles:
;; 1. Use only minimal primitives (%apply, %call/cc where needed) 
;; 2. Provide R7RS compliant semantics
;; 3. Handle multiple values correctly
;; 4. Ensure proper tail call optimization
;; 5. Handle edge cases and error conditions

;; ============= DERIVED CONDITIONAL FORMS =============

;; Note: when, unless, cond, case are typically implemented as macros
;; but we provide procedural versions where possible

;; Basic conditional utility - helper for other constructs

  (if test (thunk) (if #f #f)))

  "Execute thunk if test is false, otherwise return unspecified"
  (if test (if #f #f) (thunk)))

  "Process cond clauses - helper for cond-like constructs"

    ((car (car clauses))
     ;; test is true - execute consequent expressions
     (if (null? (cdr (car clauses)))
         ;; no consequent expressions, return test value
         (car (car clauses))
         ;; execute all consequent expressions
         (eval-sequence (cdr (car clauses)))))
    (else
     ;; test is false, try next clause
     (process-cond-clauses (cdr clauses)))))
